  * Example: Giovanni Gabrieli: "O magnum mysterium"

## Baroque Opera

  * *Monody* - applied during early Baroque - emphasis on one melodic
	line and clear voice to focus attention
  * *Recitative* - half singing, half reciting style in opera during
	action and dialogue sections - bare-bones accompaniment

  * Aria is built over a *ground bass*, a short melodic phrase in the
	bass line which continually repeats

## Instrumental Music

	dances and royal entertainment
  * In Baroque, instrumental music flourishes and expands to other
	venues
  * The *Suite* - purely instrumental genre divided into *movementes*
	with different dance forms for each movement

### Extension to Music
  
  * Music should fulfill the needs of all society, be approachable,
	simple, and nartural

	Baroque music

	melody, and having *pleasing variety*
  
#### Examples of "Pleasing Variety"

  * Rhythm
    * varies from one theme to the next
	* sometimes music may pause
  * Dynamics
    * portions of the same movement vary from loud to soft and in
	  between
	* music may gradually increase or decrease in volume (crescendo &
	  decrescendo)
  * Tone color
    * various mixtures of instruments
	* contrasting themes often carried by different insturments
  * Melody
